The programme focuses on developing the students and equipping them to meet the managerial challenges of the 21st century. The ability to work in teams is also focused upon as a key skill to be developed for success in the work-place. The programme also aims to develop the student independent thinking, decision making capability and research aptitude.

Aimed at the holistic development of the students, the Department facilitates participation in various National and International fests.
